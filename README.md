# STOR 390 Midterm Paper: Immersive Virtual Reality and Normative Concerns

This repository hosts two files (a PDF and a RMD) for the midterm project for STOR 390 Machine Learning: Ethics and Society.

The paper examines the research methodologies, results, and ethical considerations presented in “Immersion Metrics for Virtual Reality” by Matias N. Selzer and Silvia M. Castro, in which the authors aim to develop a model for predicting VR immersion using over 20 different predictors.
